# Python-Ransomware

To start with this Ransomware, you need some modifications : 

- If you don't have the packages run `pip3 install crypto`.
- Line 39 you need to change the path with your own absolute path.
- Line 84 and 118 change your fileName if you change the text.txt file.
- Then just run the ransomware.
